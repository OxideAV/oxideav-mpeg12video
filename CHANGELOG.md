# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the crate adheres
to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Clean-room rebuild round 1: parser for the MPEG-2 (ITU-T H.262 /
  ISO/IEC 13818-2) `sequence_header()` syntax element (§6.2.2.1)
  with field semantics from §6.3.3:
  - Start-code `0x000001B3` validation.
  - 12-bit horizontal/vertical size values (forbidden zero rejected).
  - 4-bit `aspect_ratio_information` decoded against Table 6-3.
  - 4-bit `frame_rate_code` (Table 6-4; forbidden zero rejected).
  - 18-bit `bit_rate_value` (forbidden zero rejected),
    `marker_bit` enforcement, 10-bit `vbv_buffer_size_value`,
    `constrained_parameters_flag`.
  - Optional `intra_quantiser_matrix[64]` and
    `non_intra_quantiser_matrix[64]` loads.
- Typed `Mpeg2SequenceHeader` and `AspectRatio` enums (re-exported
  at the crate root).
- 12 unit tests + 1 black-box integration test against an
  `ffmpeg`-produced 352×240 MPEG-2 elementary stream.

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-18** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`).

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The crates.io version
  (`0.0.11`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.

### Next

- `sequence_extension()` (§6.2.2.3) + the size/bitrate/VBV
  high-bit synthesis that combines with this round's lower bits.
- `group_of_pictures_header()` + `picture_header()` /
  `picture_coding_extension()` parsers.
- Slice/macroblock decoding, VLC tables, motion compensation, IDCT.
- `oxideav_core::Decoder` wiring once a complete picture round-trips.
