# oxideav-mpeg12video

A pure-Rust MPEG-1 Video / MPEG-2 Video codec for the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav) framework.

## Status

**Clean-room rebuild — round 1 (sequence header only).**

Master was orphan-rebuilt on **2026-05-18** under the workspace
[clean-room policy](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav/blob/master/docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md);
the prior implementation had VLC table modules whose data could not
be defended as clean-room. The rebuild starts here.

### What round 1 lands

* Parser for `sequence_header()` per **ISO/IEC 13818-2 (ITU-T H.262)
  §6.2.2.1** with field semantics from §6.3.3:
  * `sequence_header_code` = `0x000001B3` start-code check
  * 12-bit `horizontal_size_value`, 12-bit `vertical_size_value`
    (forbidden zero rejected per §6.3.3)
  * 4-bit `aspect_ratio_information` decoded against Table 6-3
    (`forbidden`, `Square`, DAR `3:4`, `9:16`, `1:2,21`, plus
    `Reserved` capture for codes 0101..1111)
  * 4-bit `frame_rate_code` (Table 6-4; forbidden zero rejected)
  * 18-bit `bit_rate_value` (forbidden zero rejected per §6.3.3)
  * `marker_bit` enforcement
  * 10-bit `vbv_buffer_size_value`
  * `constrained_parameters_flag` (semantic note: §6.3.3 says this
    has no meaning in 13818-2 and shall be `'0'`; we preserve the
    bit rather than coerce)
  * Optional 64-byte `intra_quantiser_matrix` and
    `non_intra_quantiser_matrix` loads (default-matrix `None` /
    explicit `Some([u8; 64])`)
* Typed `Mpeg2SequenceHeader { width, height, aspect_ratio,
  frame_rate_code, bit_rate, vbv_buffer_size,
  constrained_parameters, intra_quant, non_intra_quant }` return.
* 12 unit tests (every spec-defined forbidden value rejected,
  Table 6-3 codes exhaustively decoded, both quantiser-matrix
  load paths exercised).
* 1 black-box integration test against an `ffmpeg`-produced 352×240
  MPEG-2 elementary stream (fixture under `tests/fixtures/`).

### What's NOT in round 1

* `sequence_extension()` / `group_of_pictures_header()` /
  `picture_header()` / `picture_coding_extension()` parsers
* Slice / macroblock decoding, VLC tables, motion vectors, IDCT
* Encoder
* `oxideav_core::Decoder` / `Encoder` trait wiring — `register()`
  is still a no-op so the registry does not yet route to this crate

## Clean-room provenance

Every line in this crate's `src/` traces to:

* `docs/video/h262/is138182-1995.pdf` — ISO/IEC 13818-2:1995 base
  text (Recommendation ITU-T H.262 (1995 E)) §§5.2.3, 6.2.2.1,
  6.3.3, Tables 6-3 / 6-4.
* `docs/video/h262/IEC-13818-2_Specs.pdf` — second copy of the
  same spec, cross-referenced for typography.
* `oxideav-core`'s published `BitReader` MSB-first API.
* The `ffmpeg` CLI binary, used **only** as an opaque encoder for
  the integration-test fixture. Its source code was not consulted.
